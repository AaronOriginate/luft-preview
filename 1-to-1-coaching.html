            <p>Most leaders I work with aren't failing. They've just run out of people who'll tell them the truth.</p>

            <p>I'm an EMCC-accredited executive coach and a professional actor. When you're preparing for a tough conversation, I don't just talk you through it. I play the other person. We rehearse it live until you know exactly how you want to show up.</p>
            <p>Everything we discuss stays between us. That confidentiality is what makes the space safe enough to be genuinely open.</p>
