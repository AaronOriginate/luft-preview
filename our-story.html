            <h2>I was an actor before any of this.</h2>
            <p>Twenty years ago, I stood in front of audiences for a living. I learned something on stage that most leadership training ignores: you don't get better by talking about it. You get better by doing it. By rehearsing. With honest feedback from people who'll tell you what actually landed and what didn't.</p>
            <p>When I moved into corporate facilitation, I brought that with me — the belief that real practice beats any slide deck.</p>

            <h2>Difference isn't something we accommodate. It's how we work.</h2>
            <p>Every session we design starts with the people in the room — their backgrounds, their learning styles, their lived experience.</p>
            <p>I lead an interfaith group in Bristol bringing together Muslims and Jews for conversations most people avoid. That work shapes me. It reminds me that the hardest discussions produce the deepest understanding, and that creating genuine safety (not the corporate poster version) is what makes honest conversation possible.</p>
            <p>As a Jewish man who has always felt different, I don't claim to understand everyone's experience. But I know what it's like to sit in a room and wonder if you belong. That awareness runs through everything we build.</p>

            <p>Then we design from scratch. Every workshop, every coaching session, every forum theatre scenario (live role-play with professional actors) is built around what you told us.</p>

            <h2>We're selective. Not everyone is the right fit, and that's fine.</h2>
            <p>We partner with organisations that actually care about their people. Not the ones who say it in the annual report and forget it by February. The ones where the CEO rings us because a team is struggling and they want to fix it properly, not tick a box.</p>
            <p>These are organisations that invest in people because they believe it matters, not because HR said they should. We're working towards B Corp certification because the companies we admire hold themselves to that standard. We want to be held to it too.</p>
