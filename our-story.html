            <h2>I was an actor before I was a coach. That changed everything.</h2>
            <p>Twenty years ago, I stood in front of audiences for a living. I learned something on stage that most leadership training ignores: you don't get better by talking about it. You get better by doing it. By rehearsing. With honest feedback from people who'll tell you what actually landed and what didn't.</p>
            <p>When I moved into corporate facilitation, I brought that with me — the belief that real practice beats any slide deck. And over two decades of working with leaders across the UK, from Bristol boardrooms to London law firms, I've never seen anything convince me otherwise.</p>

            <h2>Difference isn't something we accommodate. It's how we work.</h2>
            <p>Every session we design starts with the people in the room — their backgrounds, their learning styles, their lived experience.</p>
            <p>I lead an interfaith group in Bristol bringing together Muslims and Jews for conversations most people avoid. That work shapes me. It reminds me that the hardest discussions produce the deepest understanding, and that creating genuine safety (not the corporate poster version) is what makes honest conversation possible.</p>
            <p>As a Jewish man who has always felt different, I don't claim to understand everyone's experience. But I know what it's like to sit in a room and wonder if you belong. That awareness runs through everything we build.</p>

            <h2>Curiosity first. Always.</h2>
            <p>We don't send you a menu of programmes. We ask questions. What's actually going on in your team? Where are the conversations that keep getting avoided? What does success look like for you — not your industry, not your competitors, you?</p>
            <p>Then we design from scratch. Every workshop, every coaching session, every forum theatre scenario (live role-play with professional actors) is built around what you told us.</p>
            <p>I'm your single point of contact from that first call through to evaluation three months later. No handoffs. No account managers. Just me and the team I trust — Kate, Jide, Pooj — all accredited coaches, all professional actors, all in the room doing the work.</p>

            <h2>We're selective. Not everyone is the right fit, and that's fine.</h2>
            <p>We partner with organisations that actually care about their people. Not the ones who say it in the annual report and forget it by February. The ones where the CEO rings us because a team is struggling and they want to fix it properly, not tick a box.</p>
            <p>Clean Growth Fund brought us in for their annual conference at Coutts in London — 60 people, real conversations about values and leadership. UK Sport asked us to work with elite athletes on personal brand and what drives them beyond performance.</p>
            <p>These are organisations that invest in people because they believe it matters, not because HR said they should. We're working towards B Corp certification because the companies we admire hold themselves to that standard. We want to be held to it too.</p>
